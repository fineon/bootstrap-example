# bootstrap-example
A project focused in using bootstrap for HTML, CSS and JS 

## What I Learned
- How to use Bootstrap classes to auto style HTML tags
- ```.img-fuild``` (a Bootstrap class) will make image width responsive, always takes up 100% width
- ```.container``` + ```.row``` + ```.col``` (Bootstrap classes) makes a great flex grid, all from Bootstrap classes
- A lot of Bootstrap classes are pre-styled, so I just need to apply them to HTML tags and i'll have all those styling. Any further styling can be added using user-named classes and overriding with ```!important``` if modifying a Bootstrap class
- Organizing Bootstrap classes vs personal stlying classes => Bootstrap classes first then personal classes last. Ex: ```class = container myTitle```
