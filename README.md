# bootstrap-example
a project focused in using bootstrap for HTML, CSS and JS 

## What I Learned
- how to use Bootstrap classes to auto style HTML tags
- .img-fuild will make image width responsive, always takes up 100% width
- .container + row + col makes a great flex grid, all from Bootstrap classes
- A lot of Bootstrap classes are pre-styled, so I just need to apply them to HTML tags and i'll have all those styling

## Tech stack

- SCSS
- Boostrap (CSS + JS), linked in HTML link + script tags
